# Who am I

My name is ZHU Chen, currently a master student at U of Tokyo, School of Engineering. Before coming to Tokyo, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Statistics at Hong Kong Baptist University. My research interests are mainly in the areas of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. I started my research in natural language processing at the beginning of 2019, and really into it. Specifically, I am interested in word representation learning, evaluations, and the language model, because these techniques are more adaptive (e.g., not hundred percent data-driven) and could be used in more general research areas.

# About this site
I was considering building my personal website very early, aiming to log what I've learned for both reviewing and sharing purposes. Currently, this site is still at a developing stage, and I will continue updating it.
